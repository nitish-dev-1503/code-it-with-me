### Problem Statement
You're designing a video game where players can equip different weapons. Each weapon has unique attributes like damage, range, and fire rate.
Identify a suitable design pattern to represent the relationship between weapons and their attributes

#### Hints
- Consider the flexibility required to add new weapons or modify existing ones.
- Think about how to avoid tightly coupling the weapon class to specific attribute values.

### Solution

#### Possible design patterns to consider
- **Factory Pattern:** Create a factory class to create different weapon objects based on their type.
- **Strategy Pattern:** Define a strategy interface for weapon attributes and implement different strategy classes for specific weapons.
- **Builder Pattern:** Use a builder pattern to construct weapon objects step-by-step, allowing for flexibility in customization.

#### Example implementation using Strategy Patterns

``` java copy 

interface Weapon {
    void attack();
}

class Sword implements Weapon {
    public void attack() {
        System.out.println("Attacking with a sword.");
    }
}

class Bow implements Weapon {
    public void attack() {
        System.out.println("Attacking with a bow.");
    }
}

class Player {
    private Weapon weapon;

    public Player(Weapon weapon) {
        this.weapon = weapon;
    }

    public void attack() {
        weapon.attack();
    }
}
```
